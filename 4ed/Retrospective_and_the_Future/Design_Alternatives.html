<h2>16.2 Design Alternatives</h2><p>


</p>
<p><tt>pbrt</tt> represents a single point in the space of rendering system designs.
The basic decisions we made early on&mdash;that ray tracing would be the
geometric visibility algorithm used, that physical correctness would be a
cornerstone of the system, that Monte Carlo would be the main approach used
for numerical integration&mdash;all had pervasive implications for the system&rsquo;s
design.

</p>
<p>There are many ways to write a renderer, and the best approach
depends on many factors: is portability important, or can the system target
a single type of computer system?  Is interaction a requirement, or is the
renderer a batch-mode system?  Is time a constraint (e.g., a requirement to
maintain a fixed frame rate), or must rendering continue until a particular
quality level is reached?  Must the system be able to render any scene no
matter how complex, or can it impose limitations on the input?

</p>
<p>Throughout the book, we have tried to always add an exercise at the end of
the chapter when we have known that there was an important design
alternative or where we made an implementation trade-off that would likely
be made differently in a rendering system with different goals than <tt>pbrt</tt>.
It is therefore worth reading the exercises even if you do not plan to do
them.  Going beyond the exercises, we will discuss a number of more radical
design alternatives for path tracing&ndash;based rendering systems that are good
to be aware of if you are designing a renderer yourself.

</p>
<p>Given well-built acceleration structures, a strength of ray tracing is that
the time spent on ray&ndash;primitive intersections grows slowly with added scene
complexity.  As such, the maximum complexity that a ray tracer can handle may
be limited more by memory than by computation.  Because rays may pass through
many different regions of the scene over a short period of time, virtual
memory often performs poorly when ray tracing complex scenes due to the
resulting incoherent memory access patterns.

</p>
<p>One way to increase the potential complexity that a renderer is capable of
handling is to reduce the memory used to store the scene.  For example,
<tt>pbrt</tt> currently uses approximately 3.3&nbsp;GB of memory to store the 24
million triangles and the BVHs in the landscape scene in
Figure&nbsp;<a href="../Primitives_and_Intersection_Acceleration/Primitive_Interface_and_Geometric_Primitives.html#fig:ecosys-instancing">7.2</a>.  This works out to an average of 148
bytes per triangle.  We have previously written ray tracers that managed an
average of 40 bytes per triangle for scenes like these, which represents a

</svg> reduction.  Reducing memory overhead requires careful attention
to memory use throughout the system. For example, in the aforementioned
system, we had three different <a href="../Shapes/Triangle_Meshes.html#Triangle"><tt>Triangle</tt></a> implementations, one
using 8-bit <tt>uint8_t</tt>s to store vertex indices, one using 16-bit
<tt>uint16_t</tt>s, and one using 32-bit <tt>uint32_t</tt>s.  The smallest
index size that was sufficient for the range of vertex indices in the mesh
was chosen at run time.  Deering&rsquo;s paper on geometry compression
(<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Deering95">Deering 1995</a>) and Ward&rsquo;s packed color format (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Ward92">Ward 1992</a>) are both
good inspirations for thinking along these lines.  See the &ldquo;Further
Reading&rdquo; section in Chapter&nbsp;<a href="../Primitives_and_Intersection_Acceleration.html#chap:acceleration">7</a> for information about
more memory-efficient representations of acceleration structures.

</p>
<p>On-demand loading of geometry and textures can also reduce
memory requirements if some parts of the scene are never needed when
rendering from a particular viewpoint.  An additional advantage of this
approach is that rendering can often start more quickly than it would
otherwise.  Taking that a step further, one might cache textures (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Peachey90">Peachey 1990</a>)
or geometry (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Pharr96">Pharr and Hanrahan 1996</a>), holding a fixed amount of it in memory and
discarding that which has not been accessed recently when the cache is
full.  This approach is especially useful for scenes with much
tessellated geometry, where a compact higher-level shape representation
like a subdivision surface can explode into a large number of triangles:
when available memory is low, some of this geometry can be discarded and
regenerated later if needed.  With the advent of economical flash memory storage
offering gigabytes per second of read bandwidth, this approach is even more
attractive.

</p>
<p>
The performance of such caches can be substantially improved by reordering
the rays that are traced in order to improve their spatial and thus memory
coherence (Pharr et al. <a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Pharr97">1997</a>).  An easier-to-implement and
more effective approach to improving the cache&rsquo;s behavior was described by
Christensen et al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Christensen03">2003</a>), who wrote a ray tracer that
uses simplified representations of the scene geometry in a geometry cache.
More recently, Yoon et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:yoonrlod">2006</a>), Budge
et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Budge09">2009</a>), Moon et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Moon2010">2010</a>), and Hanika
et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Hanika2010">2010</a>) have developed improved approaches to this
problem.  See Rushmeier, Patterson, and Veerasamy
(<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Rushmeier:1993:GSF">1993</a>) for an early example of how to use
simplified scene representations when computing indirect illumination.

</p>
<p>Disney&rsquo;s <em>Hyperion</em> renderer is an example of a renderer for feature
films that maintains a large collection of active rays and then sorts them
in order to improve the coherence of geometry and texture cache access.
See the papers by Eisenacher et al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Eisenacher2013">2013</a>) and Burley
et al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Burley2018">2018</a>) for details of its implementation.

</p>
<p>Another form of complexity that is required for feature film production is
in the form of surface shading; in contrast to <tt>pbrt</tt>&rsquo;s fairly simple
texture blending capabilities, production renderers typically provide
procedural shading languages that make it possible to compute material
parameters by combining multiple image maps and procedural patterns such as
those generated by noise functions in user-provided shader programs.
Evaluating these shaders can be a major component of rendering cost.

</p>
<p>An innovative solution to this challenge has been implemented in Weta
Digital&rsquo;s <em>Manuka</em> renderer, which is described in a paper by Fascione
et al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Fascione2018">2018</a>).  In a first rendering phase, <em>Manuka</em>
tessellates all the scene geometry into grids of <em>micropolygons</em>,
subpixel-sized triangles.  (This approach is inspired by the Reyes
rendering algorithm (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Cook87">Cook et&nbsp;al. 1987</a>).)  Procedural shaders are then evaluated at
the polygon vertices and the resulting material parameters are stored.

</p>
<p>Path tracing then proceeds using these micropolygons.  At each intersection
point, no shader evaluation is necessary and the material parameters are
interpolated from nearby vertices in order to instantiate a BSDF.  Because
micropolygons are subpixel sized, there is no visible error from not
evaluating the surface shader at the actual intersection point.

</p>
<p>If the total number of ray intersections to be shaded during rendering is
larger than the number of micropolygons, this approach is generally
beneficial.  It offers additional benefits from exhibiting coherent texture
image map accesses and from simultaneous evaluation of shaders at many
vertices during the first phase, which makes the workload amenable to SIMD
processing.  Downsides of this approach include the issue that if a
substantial amount of the scene&rsquo;s geometry is occluded and never accessed
during rendering, then the work to generate those micropolygon grids will
have been wasted.  It also causes startup time to increase due to the first
phase of computation and thus a longer wait before initial pixel values can
be displayed.  Caching preshaded micropolygon grids can help.

</p>
<p>A related approach is described by Munkberg
et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Munkberg2016">2016</a>), who cache shaded results in surface
textures during rendering.  These cached values can then be reused over
multiple frames of an animation and used to accelerate rendering effects
like depth of field.

<p>Early work on parallel tracing focused on multiprocessors (Cleary et
al. <a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Cleary:1983:DAA">1983</a>; <a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Green:1989:ECF">Green and Paddon 1989</a>;
<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Badouel:1989:AEP">Badouel and Priol 1989</a>) and clusters of computers (Parker
et&nbsp;al. <a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Parker:1999:IRT">1999</a>; Wald et al. <a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Wald01a">2001a</a>,

</p>
<p>More recently, as multi-core CPUs have become the norm and as CPUs have
added computational capability through wider SIMD vector units,
high-performance CPU ray-tracing research has focused on effectively using
both multi-core and SIMD vector parallelism.  Parallelizing ray tracing
over multiple CPU cores in a single computer is not too difficult; 
the screen-space decomposition that <tt>pbrt</tt> uses is a common approach.  Making good use
of SIMD units is trickier; this is something that <tt>pbrt</tt> does not try
to do in the interests of avoiding the corresponding code complexity.

</p>
<p>SIMD widths of 8 to&nbsp;16 32-bit <tt>float</tt>s are typical on current CPUs.
Achieving the full potential performance of CPUs therefore requires using
SIMD effectively.  Achieving excellent utilization of SIMD vector units
generally requires that the entire computation be expressed in a <em>data
parallel</em> manner, where the same computation is performed on many data
elements simultaneously.  A natural way to extract data parallelism in a
ray tracer is to have each processing core responsible for tracing <svg xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="1.395ex" height="1.676ex" style="vertical-align: -0.338ex;" viewBox="0 -576.1 600.5 721.6" role="img" focusable="false" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-labelledby="MathJax-SVG-1-Title">

</svg> is at least the SIMD width.
Each SIMD vector lane is then responsible for just a single ray,
and each vector instruction performs a single scalar computation for
each of the rays it is responsible for. Thus, high SIMD utilization comes
naturally, at least until some rays require different
computations than others.

</p>
<p>This approach, <em>packet tracing</em>, was first introduced by Wald
et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Wald01a">2001a</a>). It has since seen wide adoption.  In a packet
tracer, acceleration structure traversal algorithms are implemented so that
they visit a node if <em>any</em> of the rays in the packet passes through
it; primitives in the leaves are tested for intersection with all the
rays in the packet, and so forth.

</p>
<p>Reshetov et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:mlrt05">2005</a>) generalized packet tracing, showing
that gathering up many rays from a single origin into a frustum and then
using the frustum for acceleration structure traversal could lead to very
high-performance ray tracing; they refined the frusta into subfrusta and
eventually the individual rays as they reached lower levels of the tree.
Reshetov (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Reshetov07">2007</a>) later introduced a technique for
efficiently intersecting a collection of rays against a collection of
triangles in acceleration structure leaf nodes by generating a frustum
around the rays and using it for first-pass culling.  See Benthin and Wald
(<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Benthin09">2009</a>) for a technique to use ray frusta and packets for
efficient shadow rays.

</p>
<p>While packet tracing is effective for coherent collections of rays that
mostly follow the same path through acceleration structures, it is much
less effective for incoherent collections of rays, which are common
with global illumination algorithms.  To address this issue, Christensen
et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Christensen2006">2006</a>), Ernst and Greiner
(<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Ernst2008">2008</a>), Wald et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Wald2008">2008</a>), and Dammertz
et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Dammertz2008">2008</a>) proposed only traversing a single ray
through the acceleration structure at once but improving SIMD efficiency by
simultaneously testing each ray against a number of bounding boxes at each
step in the hierarchy.  Fuetterling et&nbsp;al. extended such approaches to
the 16-wide SIMD units that are available on some recent CPUs
(<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Fuetterling2017">Fuetterling et al. 2017</a>).

</p>
<p><em>Embree</em>, described in a paper by Wald et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Wald2014">2014</a>),
is a high-performance open source rendering system that supports both
packet tracing and highly efficient traversal of single rays on the CPU.
See also the paper by Benthin et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Benthin2011">2011</a>) on the topic
of finding a balance between these two approaches.

</p>
<p>Another approach to the ray incoherence problem is to reorder small batches
of incoherent rays to improve SIMD efficiency; representative work in this
area includes papers by Mansson et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Mansson07">2007</a>), Boulos
et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Boulos08">2008</a>), Gribble and Ramani (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Gribble08">2008</a>),
and Tsakok (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Tsakok09">2009</a>).  More recently, Barringer and
Akenine-M&ouml;ller (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Barringer2014">2014</a>) developed a SIMD ray-traversal
algorithm that delivered substantial performance improvements
given large numbers of rays.

</p>
<p>Effectively applying SIMD to the rest of the rendering computation often
requires sorting work to improve coherence; see for example &Aacute;fra
et&nbsp;al.&rsquo;s approach for sorting materials between pipeline stages to improve
SIMD utilization (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Afra2016">&Aacute;fra et al. 2016</a>).  Many of the same principles used for
efficient GPU ray tracing discussed in the &ldquo;Further Reading&rdquo; section of
Chapter&nbsp;<a href="../Wavefront_Rendering_on_GPUs.html#chap:gpu">15</a> also apply.

</p>
<p>These algorithms are often implemented with the SIMD vectorization
made explicit: intersection functions are written to explicitly take some
number of rays as a parameter rather than just a single ray, and so forth.
In contrast, as we saw in Chapter&nbsp;<a href="../Wavefront_Rendering_on_GPUs.html#chap:gpu">15</a>, the parallelism in
programs written for GPUs is generally implicit: code is written as if it
operates on a single ray at a time, but the underlying
hardware actually executes it in parallel.

</p>
<p>It is possible to use the implicit model on CPUs as well.  Parker et&nbsp;al.&rsquo;s
(<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Parker07">2007</a>) ray-tracing shading language is an example of
compiling an implicitly data-parallel language to a SIMD instruction set on
CPUs.  See also Georgiev and Slusallek&rsquo;s (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Georgiev08">2008</a>) work,
where generic programming techniques are used in C++ to implement
a high-performance ray tracer with details like packets well hidden.
<tt>ispc</tt>, described in a paper by Pharr and Mark (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Pharr2012">2012</a>),
provides a general-purpose &ldquo;single program multiple data&rdquo; (SPMD) language
for CPU vector units that also provides this model.
The <em>MoonRay</em> rendering system, which was developed at DreamWorks,
uses <tt>ispc</tt> to target CPU SIMD units.  The paper by Lee et
al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Lee2017">2017</a>) describes its implementation and also discusses
the important issue of maintaining data parallel computation when
evaluating surface shaders.

</p>
<p>If a rendering system can provide many rays for intersection tests at once,
a variety of alternatives beyond packet tracing are possible.  For example,
Keller and W&auml;chter (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Keller2011">2011</a>) and Mora
(<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Mora2011">2011</a>) described algorithms for intersecting a large number
of rays against the scene geometry where there is no acceleration structure
at all. Instead, primitives and rays are both recursively partitioned until
small collections of rays and small collections of primitives remain, at
which point intersection tests are performed.  Improvements to this
approach were described by &Aacute;fra (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Afra2012">2012</a>) and Nabata
et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Nabata2013">2013</a>).

</p>
<p><tt>pbrt</tt> is very much a one-frame-at-a-time rendering system.  Renderers that
specifically target animation or allow the user to interact with the scene
being rendered operate under a substantially different set of constraints,
which leads to different designs.

</p>
<p>Interactive rendering systems have the additional challenge that the scene
to be rendered may not be known until shortly before it is time to render
it, since the user is able to make changes to it.  Fast algorithms for
building or refitting acceleration structures are critical, and it may be
necessary to limit the number of rays traced in order to reach a desired
frame rate.  The task, then, is to make the best image possible using a
fixed number of rays, which requires the ability to allocate rays from a
budget.  As current hardware is generally not able to trace enough rays
to generate noise-free path-traced images at real-time rates, such systems
generally have denoising algorithms deeply integrated into their display
pipeline as well.

</p>
<p>A system that renders a sequence of images for an animation has the
opportunity to reuse information temporally across frames, ranging from
pixel values themselves to data structures that represent the distribution
of light in the scene.  An early application of this idea was described by
Ghosh et al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Ghosh2006:smc">2006</a>), who applied
it to rendering glossy surfaces lit by environment
light sources. Scherzer et
al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Scherzer2011">2011</a>) provided a comprehensive survey of work in
this area until 2011.

</p>
<p>More recent examples of techniques that apply temporal reuse include the
SVGF denoising algorithm (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Schied2017">Schied et al. 2017</a>, <a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Schied2018">2018</a>), which
reuses reprojected pixel colors across frames when appropriate, and the
ReSTIR direct lighting technique (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Bitterli2020">Bitterli et al. 2020</a>), which reuses light
samples across nearby pixels and frames of an animation to substantially
improve the quality of direct lighting in scenes with many light sources.
Other recent work in this area includes Dittebrandt et al.&rsquo;s temporal
sample reuse approach (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Dittebrandt2020">2020</a>), Hasselgren et al.&rsquo;s
temporal adaptive sampling and denoising algorithm
(<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Hasselgren2020">2020</a>), and the extension of ReSTIR to path-traced
indirect illumination by Ouyang et al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Ouyang2021">2021</a>).

</p>
<p>OptiX, which was described by Parker et&nbsp;al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:Parker2010">2010</a>), has an
interesting system structure: it is a combination of built-in functionality
(e.g., for building acceleration structures and traversing rays through
them) that can be extended by user-supplied code (e.g., for shape
intersections and surface shading). Many renderers over the years have
allowed user extensibility of this sort, usually through some kind of
plug-in architecture. OptiX is distinctive in that it is built using a
runtime compilation system that brings all of this code together before
optimizing&nbsp;it.

</p>
<p>Because the compiler has a view of the entire system when generating the
final code,
the resulting custom renderer can be automatically specialized in a variety
of ways. For example, if the surface-shading code never uses the <svg xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="5.301ex" height="2.843ex" style="vertical-align: -0.838ex;" viewBox="0 -863.1 2282.2 1223.9" role="img" focusable="false" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-labelledby="MathJax-SVG-1-Title">

texture coordinates, the code that computes them in the triangle shape
intersection test can be optimized out as dead code.  Or, if the ray&rsquo;s time
field is never accessed, then both the code that sets it and even the structure
member itself can be eliminated.  This approach allows a degree of
specialization (and resulting performance) that would be difficult to
achieve manually, at least for more than a single system variant.

</p>
<p>An even more aggressive specialization approach is implemented in the
<em>Rodent</em> system, which is described in a paper by P&eacute;rard-Gayot et
al. (<a href="Further_Reading.html#cite:PerardGayot19">2019</a>), who also cover previous work in specialization
for graphics computations.  <em>Rodent</em> specializes the entire renderer based on
the provided scene description, eliminating unnecessary logic in order to
improve performance.
